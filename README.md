## Prerequisites

* Python 3.7
* Pip3
* VirtualEnv

## Configuring Python 3.7

This software is developed using Python 3.7 using a virtual environment to
manage Python versions.

To configure the Virtual environment:

```
virtualenv venv
```

Activating the venv

```
source venv/bin/activate
```

## Debugging

The Python debugger can be used to help during development of the software

```
python -m pdb coursework.py
```
